<a name='v148'></a><hr><h3>Changes in Version 1.48</h3>
[b]Changes[/b]
[list][*]All CreateImage variants use load ftEngine.LoadImage now where it is needed. That takes care of loading an image only once.
  
[*]Added a reset of the engine color to 255,255,255 before each render task. This should take care that the first objects color gets changed.
  
[*]CreateTileMap:ftObject(fname:string, startX:Float, startY:Float ) now is able to load maps from a sub folder inside the data directory. Still you need to make sure, that all references of image inside the JSON file are without paths and are located inside the same folder as your JSON file.
    
[*]All parameter types functions that don't need a return parameters were set to VOID.
  
[*]All ftEngine.Create[i]Something[/i] methods will accept an optional object parameter. This way you can extend your own object class from the [b]ftObject[/b] class and use this. Be aware that in all event handling methods, the object will be casted into a [b]ftObject[/b]. 

[*]ftObject.GetSpeed/ftObject.GetSpeedAngle now reported correct values when you used a negative speed on an object
  
[*]layer/object transitions, object timers are not updated as long as the engine is paused (see ftEngine.SetPause)

[*]Removed the "reflection" dependency by copying an object manually. That should reduce the size of the created native code again.
  
[*]All methods are documented in a Jungle-IDE compatible style.

[*]Added time scaling in timers, transitions and also object updating. Set the scale via ftEngine.SetTimeScale.[/list]  
  
[b]Fixes[/b][list][*]ftObject.SetColWith:Int (s:Int,e:Int,b:Bool) wasn't setting an internal flag so the collision detection for all objects of a layer didn't work if you used that command.

[*]Removed the double call to Cleanuplists inside ftLayer.Update.

[*]ftObject.GetSpin() returned the wrong value.[/list]

[b]New classes[/b]
[list][*]ftBox2D        &emsp;[i](experimental, subject of change)[/i]
This class integrates the Box2D engine. Just make sure you have a box2D module installed. Have a look at the new example Box2DIntegration.monkey to see how it is working. Please note that you need to add another import statement "Import cftBox2D" at the top.  

[*]ftPath        &emsp;[i](experimental, subject of change)[/i]
The new path/waypoint class. It supports linear and catmull rom type of path movement between its nodes.
