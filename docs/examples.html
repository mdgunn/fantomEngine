They are located inside the <i>examples</i> folder located in your <b>fantomEngine</b> module installation.<br><br><b>Base script</b><br>To see a skeleton script for the fantomEngine, have a look at the <a href="../examples/BaseScript/BaseScript.monkey">BaseScript.monkey</a> script. <br><br><b>Set the blend mode</b><br>Sometimes you need to see the blendmode of an object. For this you can study the <a href="../examples/Objects/Appearance/BlendMode/BlendMode.monkey">BlendMode.monkey</a> script.<br><br><b>Extend an object</b><br>When you need to extend an object, have a look at the <a href="../examples/Objects/Creation/CustomObject/CustomObject.monkey">CustomObject.monkey</a> script. <br><br><b>Copy an object</b><br>When you need to copy an object, have a look at the <a href="../examples/Objects/Creation/CopyObject/CopyObject.monkey">CopyObject.monkey</a> script. <br><br><b>Drawing Primitives</b><br>fantomEngine supports different drawing primitves and the <a href="../examples/Objects/Creation/CreatePrimitives/CreatePrimitives.monkey">CreatePrimitives.monkey</a> script by Douglas Williams tell you how. <br><br><b>Multiline text</b><br>To display multiline text, have a look at the <a href="../examples/Text/MultilineText/MultilineText.monkey">MultilineText.monkey</a> script.<br><br><b>FontMachine</b><br>If you want to use FontMachine fonts, you don't need to do anything special: <a href="../examples/Text/FontMachine/FontMachine.monkey">FontMachine.monkey</a>.<br><br><b>Object movement</b><br>If you want to find out how to move objects and handle them in the OnObjectUpdate event, have a look at the <a href="../examples/Objects/Behaviour/ObjectMovement/ObjectMovement.monkey">ObjectMovement.monkey</a> script. <br><br><b>Transitions</b><br>If you want to use transitions with tweeing, then have a look at the <a href="../examples/Transitions/ObjectTransition/ObjectTransition.monkey">ObjectTransition.monkey</a> script. <br><br><b>Parent and childs</b><br>If you need a parent child relationship of your objects, have a look at the <a href="../examples/Objects/Hierachy/ParentChild/ParentChild.monkey">ParentChild.monkey</a> script. <br><br><b>Load images</b><br>When you need to load images, it is good to have a look at this example: <a href="../examples/Objects/Creation/LoadImage/LoadImage.monkey">LoadImage.monkey</a>. <br><br><b>Remove Objects</b><br>If you need to remove objects, have a look at the <a href="../examples/Objects/Creation/RemoveObject/RemoveObject.monkey">RemoveObject.monkey</a> script. <br><br><b>Sort Objects</b><br>If you need to sort objects in layers, have a look at the <a href="../examples/Objects/Hierachy/SortObjects/SortObjects.monkey">SortObjects.monkey</a> script. <br><br><b>Storing user defined data</b><br>Sometime you need to store extra information inside an ftObject. For this, have a look at the <a href="../examples/Objects/DataStorage/DataStorage.monkey">DataStorage.monkey</a> script. <br><br><b>Swipe/Gesture detection</b><br>To find out how to use the swipe gesture detection, check out the <a href="../examples/Input/SwipeDetection/SwipeDetection.monkey">SwipeDetection.monkey</a> script.<br><br><b>Texture atlas / Sprite sheets</b><br>Sprite sheets are a great way to preserve video memory and also speed up the render process. To use texture atlas created by the tool <a href="http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker">TexturePacker</a>, check out the <a href="../examples/SpriteSheets/TexturePacker/TexturePacker.monkey">TexturePacker.monkey</a> script.<br><br><b>Tile maps</b><br>For big tile maps, created by the tool Tiled, have a look at the <a href="../examples/TileMaps/Tiled/Tiled.monkey">Tiled.monkey</a> script. It even handles map objects now.<br><br>If you need to build a map dynamically, have a look at this script: <a href="../examples/TileMaps/DynamicMap/DynamicMap.monkey">DynamicMap.monkey</a>.<br><br>To see how you could do collision checks against a Tiled platformer level, have a look at this script: <a href="../examples/TileMaps/Platformer/Platformer.monkey">Platformer.monkey</a>.<br><br><b>Paths and waypoints</b><br>To use paths/waypoints and how to move an object along a path, have a look at the <a href="../examples/Waypoints/Waypoints.monkey">Waypoints.monkey</a> script.<br><br><b>A* path finding</b><br>If you need to utilize A* path finding in your game, then the <a href="../examples/Pathfinding/Pathfinding.monkey">Pathfinding.monkey</a> script is the place to look at.<br><br><b>Box2D physics</b><br>There are several examples on how to integrate Box2D physics with fantomEngine. Here is a short list...<br><ul><li><a href="../examples/Physics/Box2DIntegration/Box2DIntegration.monkey">Box2DIntegration.monkey</a><br><li><a href="../examples/Physics/JuggleSoccerBall/JuggleSoccerBall.monkey">JuggleSoccerBall.monkey</a><br><li><a href="../examples/Physics/MouseJoint/MouseJoint.monkey">MouseJoint.monkey</a><br><li><a href="../examples/Physics/Raycasting/Raycasting.monkey">Raycasting.monkey</a><br><li><a href="../examples/Physics/RevoluteJoint/RevoluteJoint.monkey">RevoluteJoint.monkey</a></ul><br><br><b>Localization</b><br>If you need a simple way to display text in different languages then have a look at this script: <a href="../examples/Localization/Localization.monkey">Localization.monkey</a>. <br><br><b>Keymapping</b><br>Sometimes you need to support different input schemes for your games. The <a href="../examples/Input/KeyMapping/KeyMapping.monkey">KeyMapping.monkey</a> shows you how you can handle this. <br><br><b>Let an object flash</b><br>If you need to draw attention to an object, let it flash like in this script (extended by Douglas Williams)... <a href="../examples/Objects/Appearance/FlashObject/FlashObject2.monkey">FlashObject2.monkey</a> <br><br><b>Layers</b><br>If scrolling layers is still a black book for you, then maybe this script from fellow fantomEngine user Douglas Williams will help you... <a href="../examples/Layer/ScrollingLayers/ScrollingLayers.monkey">ScrollingLayers.monkey</a><br><br><b>Jump 'n' example</b><br>There are several ways to create a jump 'n' run game in fantomEngine.

To have a go at this feature, look at this example: <a href="../examples/Scenes/SceneCreation/SceneCreation.monkey">SceneCreation.monkey</a>. <br><br><b>Animate an object</b><br>Besides using an image strip like you do in Mojo, you can build animations in fantomEngine by adding several images to an object. Have a look at this example: <a href="../examples/Objects/Creation/AnimObject/AnimObject.monkey">AnimObject.monkey</a>. <br><br><b>Update objects</b><br>To see how you can update your objects, have a look here: <a href="../examples/Misc/UpdateObjects/UpdateObjects.monkey">UpdateObjects.monkey</a>. <br><br><b>Using Timer</b><br>Tiemr make your game tick.
